Part 1, Service timer.

Launch:  roslaunch not_a_project function_timer.launch

The test function was first set up to receive a float value and return a boolean.

Then to use bigger data, the median filter from home work 3 was implemented as the test function.
This test function received a laserscan message and returned the filtered laserscan.

The timer node averages over 100 service calls and writes the average time to a file named AverageTimes.txt in the working directory.

Implemented in cpp.

Results from when I ran the timer:

              Small Data    Big Data
Service Call: 0.0011        0.00185
Local Call:   0.00005       0.00027
