The python script behaved as expected. ~0 sec with no other processes running.
Then increasing by ~0.25 sec to run one process and doubling that time to run two processes.

The cpp timer did not run as expected. The timer by itself took ~0.067 sec to run by itself.
I'm not sure were that came from, possibly the mapped container that was used to keep track of the scan lines.
Then there was a small increase in time of ~0.001 sec for each additional node that was ran.
This is small increase in time seems more typical of a cpp process.
